# Translator_App
It is an web app that can help you translate whatever you want to your specific language. I created it using an rapid API.

Steps to have the app running on your local server
* Fork and clone the repository.
* Open Terminal in the cloned directory.
* hit npm init
* Now copy your api key from raoidapi.com of google translator.
* Create a file named .env in your working directory and open the file.
* Now write the following in the file: translator_api_key= "your api key"   
* Now you can run the Translator app on your machine.
* After completing the above steps, run node server.js in the terminal along with that. 
* After that write localhost:3000 on the browser and you are good to go to use app.
